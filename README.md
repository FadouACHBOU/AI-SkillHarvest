# AI Skills Harvest

Welcome to AI Skills Harvest! This project aims to develop a supervised scoring model based on BERT for skill analysis from resumes in PDF format. Additionally, it involves setting up a Flask API to call the prediction model and creating an interactive dashboard using Streamlit for client relationship managers.

## Usage
